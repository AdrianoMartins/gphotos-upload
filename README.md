# gphotos-upload
Simple but flexible script to upload photos to Google Photos. Useful if you have photos in a directory structure that you want to reflect as Google Photos albums.
## Setup
1. 
2. Make sure you have [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your system
3. Install [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) via `pip install pipenv`
4. Change to the directory where you installed this script
5. Run `pipenv install` to download and install all the dependencies
6. Run `pipenv shell` to open a shell with all the dependencies available (you'll need to do this every time you want to run the script)
7. Now run the script via `python upload.py` as desired
